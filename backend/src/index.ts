/**
 * This indexer tracks and maintains the state of the Relay Lending Protocol across multiple chains.
 *
 * 1. Pool transaction tracking
 * 2. Yield strategy performance metrics
 *
 * Performance Considerations:
 * - Uses efficient upsert patterns for balance updates
 * - Maintains normalized data structure for quick queries
 *
 * Database Schema Design:
 * - Pool transactions are tracked in real-time
 * - Yield strategies track both actions and current balances
 *
 * @note This indexer assumes events are received in chronological order per chain
